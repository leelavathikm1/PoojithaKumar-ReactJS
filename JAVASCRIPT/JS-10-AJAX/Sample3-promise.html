    <!-- Async/Await. A Promise represents an intermediate state of an operation and is guaranteed to complete its
      execution at some point in the future. Async/Await is syntactic sugar for Promises,
      making asynchronous code behave more synchronously. Promise has 3 states - resolved, rejected and pending. -->

    <!-- In JavaScript, both Promises and async/await are used to handle asynchronous operations, but they differ in their approach and syntax.
Promises:
Promises are objects that represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.
A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled (resolved), or rejected.
Promises use .then() for handling successful results and .catch() for handling errors.
They can be chained together to handle sequences of asynchronous operations.
Async/Await:
Async/await is syntactic sugar built on top of promises, designed to make asynchronous code look and behave more like 
synchronous code.
The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, which implicitly returns a promise.
The await keyword is used inside an async function to pause execution until a promise resolves or rejects.
It simplifies the structure of asynchronous code, making it easier to read and write.  -->
